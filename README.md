ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name is Eric Ladage and this is my github

Pretty sparse - most of my repos are private and most of my work is unfortunately on several different Enterprise Github accounts :(

What I'm using these days

- front end
   - react
   - typescript
   - tailwind
   - nextjs
   - vite

- back end
  - typescript
  - zod
  - prisma
  - mysql

- ops
  - vercel
  - aws
  - github
